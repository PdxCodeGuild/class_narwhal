Lab 12: Guess the Number
1) the computer will pick a random number between 1 and 10
2) the user will try to guess that number
3) if the guess is correct, tell the user "that's correct!"
4) otherwise, tell the user "that's incorrect!"

step 2
compare the target and guess
if the target is greater than the guess, print 'higher'
otherwise, print 'lower'
