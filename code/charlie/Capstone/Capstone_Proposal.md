# Project Name
## "Zellis" (kinda like trellis) or "Plant-Fu"
    - Zellis will the have capabilities to create a new user 
    and allow for daily photo updates to track plant health. The
    application would ideally be a social platform

# Project Overview
    - My application Zellis is trying to provide people with
     a way to actively track their plants' progression from seedling to bloom. They will
     be able to create a profile and upload different plants with pictures.
     The comment system is aimed at providing a fun, social experience around gardening
     especially since the introduction of this latest pandemic. There's only so much gardening and
     a lot of time for people to be at home these days.
