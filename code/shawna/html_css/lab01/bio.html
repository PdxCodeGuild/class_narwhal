                            Audrey Hepburn was an actress, fashion icon, and philanthropist who was born in Belgium. She is one of the few actresses to win an Emmy, Tony, Grammy and Academy Award. In her later years, acting took a back seat to her <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn"> work on behalf of children.</a>

            <p>Towards the end of the 1980s, Hepburn was wrapping up her film career. Instead of spending the last years of her life at a comfortable estate, she became a Special Ambassador for UNICEF. She wanted to help UNICEF provide aid to those in need because, as a starving child in the Netherlands during World War II, she benefited from UNICEF’s aid when they brought much-needed food and medicine to her country. Another factor that pushed Hepburn to pursue a role with UNICEF was her love for children. She has been quoted as saying, “When I was little, I used to embarrass my mother by trying to pick babies out of prams at the market. The one thing I dreamed of in my life was to have children of my own. It always boils down to the same thing–of not only receiving love but wanting desperately to give it.”</p>
