    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Alan Watts</a></h1>
    <h2>Philosopher</h2>
    <h3>6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973</h3>
    <h4>British philosopher, writer, and speaker known for interpreting and popularising Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism for a Western audience.</h4>
    <p>“Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Alan Watts had the rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the un-writable’.</p>
    <p>Watts begins with scholarship and intellect and proceeds with art and eloquence to the frontiers of the spirit. A fascinating entry into the deepest ways of knowing.”</p>

    <blockquote>"We do not 'come into' this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean 'waves', the universe 'peoples'."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Every individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree."</blockquote>
