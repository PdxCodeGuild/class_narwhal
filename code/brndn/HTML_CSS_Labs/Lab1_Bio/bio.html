    <p>“Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Alan Watts had the rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the un-writable’.</p>
    <p>Watts begins with scholarship and intellect and proceeds with art and eloquence to the frontiers of the spirit. A fascinating entry into the deepest ways of knowing.”</p>

      <blockquote>"This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"We do not 'come into' this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean 'waves', the universe 'peoples'."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Every individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree."</blockquote>
