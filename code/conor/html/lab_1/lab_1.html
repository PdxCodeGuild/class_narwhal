    <p>Generally speaking, Ben Hogan is considered to be one of the Greatest Golfers of all time.
      His contributions to the game have lasted the test of time from his unique playing style to
      the invasive "Swing Secret" that took him years to reveal. He is one of only 5 players to have
      want all 4 Major Championships which will likely remain to be a small number as the years go
      along. Hogan was known to practice more than anybody else in that time period, giving him
      the unofficial credit of "inventing" practice. Racking up 63 PGA Tour victories, Hogan also
      authored a book called "Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf" which has been the most 
      read title on the subject since it was published. A car accident in 1949 left him brutally
      injured and doctors told him he many never walk again. Despite the serious setback, Hogan
      slowly made his way back to competition, thus the PGA Tour created an award in his name for
      players that have perservered through their careers with injury or illness. Hogan was inducted
      into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.</p>
