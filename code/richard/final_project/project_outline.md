# Are you smarter than a machine learning algorithm?

## Project Overview
I will build a web app that summarizes what happened to the passengers of the titanic in a dashboard and allows users to play a game to see how well they are able to predict who did and did not perish. It will require users to login to play the game and a leaderboard will summarize how each of the players has done over time an compare it to a machine learning algorithym. 
If people can consistantly beat the algorithm then there is no need for the algorithm.
The big picture is to prove to my clients that I am capable of turning data into valuable predictions and those predictions are better than the ones they can do themselves.
This project may only be a fun game but it can and should be used as a template for future client work. 
The logic is that
