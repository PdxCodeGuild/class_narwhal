Version 1
The goal is to calculate how many years it will take for two jackalopes to create a population of 1000.

Jackalopes are reproductive from ages 4-8 and die at age 10.
Gestation is instantaneous. Each gestation produces two offspring.
Jackalopes are hermaphrodites, it takes a pair to reproduce, but any pair will do
With these conditions in mind, we can represent our population as a list of ints.
